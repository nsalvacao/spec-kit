# Vision Brief: [AI System Name]

**Generated**: [ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP]
**Derived From**: AI Vision Canvas (18 components)

<!--
Guidance:

- Use the 7-section handoff format to align with Gate G0 automated checks.
- Job statement must use: "When [situation], I want [motivation], so I can [outcome]."
-->

## One-Liner

[Single sentence project description - from canvas synthesis]

**Canvas References**: C7 (Solution), C12 (AI Task)

## Problem Statement

**Job-to-be-Done**: When [situation], I want [motivation], so I can [outcome].

**Context**: [Job Context from canvas component 3]

**Current Solution Pains**: [From canvas component 5]

**Canvas References**: C1 (Job Statement), C3 (Context), C5 (Pains)

## Solution Approach

**High-Level Design**: [Lean Solution from canvas component 7, integrated with AI Task from component 12]

**AI Approach**: [Model Approach from canvas component 14]

**How It Works**: [Conceptual flow integrating JTBD, Lean, AI sections]

**Canvas References**: C7 (Solution), C12 (AI Task), C14 (Model Approach), C15 (Evaluation)

## Success Criteria

[Transformed from canvas component 10 - Key Metrics, formatted as measurable outcomes]

1. [Metric 1 from canvas → Success criterion]
2. [Metric 2 from canvas → Success criterion]
3. [Metric 3+ from canvas → Success criterion]

**Canvas References**: C10 (Key Metrics)

## Key Assumptions

[From canvas component 8, with validation methods from component 9]

| Assumption | Validation Method | Risk If Wrong | Tracking |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| [Assumption 1] | [From component 9] | [Impact] | [How monitored] |
| [Assumption 2] | [From component 9] | [Impact] | [How monitored] |
| [Assumption 3] | [From component 9] | [Impact] | [How monitored] |

**Canvas References**: C8 (Assumptions), C9 (Validation Methods)

## Data & Model Strategy

**Data Requirements**: [From canvas component 13 - Sources, Quality, Labeling, Bias, Privacy]

- [Source 1 + availability %]
- [Source 2 + availability %]
- [Source 3 + availability %]

**Model Approach**: [From canvas component 14 - Family, Selection, Rationale, Prompts]

**Evaluation**: [From canvas component 15 - Primary Metrics, Benchmarks, Human Evals]

**Canvas References**: C13 (Data Requirements), C14 (Model Approach), C15 (Evaluation)

## Constraints & Risks

**Budget Constraints**: [From canvas component 11 + 17]

**Technical Constraints**: [From canvas component 17 - Latency, Context, etc.]

**Safety Risks**: [From canvas component 16 - table with mitigations]

**Compliance**: [From canvas component 16 - regulatory requirements]

**Canvas References**: C11 (Cost), C17 (Constraints), C16 (Safety & Risk)
