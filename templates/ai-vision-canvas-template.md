# AI System Vision Canvas: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Generated**: [ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP]
**Selected Idea**: [IDEA_ID] - [Short label]

<!--
Guidance:

- JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) frames the user's progress in context (job statement + outcomes).
- Lean Startup emphasizes hypotheses and validated learning (Build-Measure-Learn).
- AI Risk Management should cover safety, transparency, robustness, and evaluation readiness.
-->

## SECTION 1: JOBS-TO-BE-DONE (5 components)

### 1. Job Statement (When/Want/So)

**When** [situation], **I want** [motivation], **so I can** [outcome].

### 2. Job Executor

Who performs the job? (role/persona)

### 3. Job Context

Where/when does this job occur? Constraints and environment.

### 4. Desired Outcomes

List measurable functional, emotional, and social outcomes.

### 5. Current Solution Pains

What is inadequate today? Where does current approach fail?

## SECTION 2: LEAN STARTUP (6 components)

### 6. Top 3 Problems

The three most critical problems to solve.

### 7. Solution (High-Level)

Describe the solution approach (no tech stack yet).

### 8. Key Assumptions (Critical, Unvalidated)

List hypotheses that must be validated.

### 9. Validation Methods (Build-Measure-Learn)

For each assumption, define how you will test and measure.

### 10. Key Metrics (Success Criteria)

Define measurable indicators of success.

### 11. Cost Structure (Budget Constraints)

Budget, time constraints, and cost drivers.

## SECTION 3: AI-SPECIFIC (7 components)

### 12. AI Task

What does the AI predict, classify, generate, or decide?

### 13. Data Requirements

Sources, volume, quality, labeling needs, privacy constraints.

### 14. Model Approach

Model family, prompting strategy, and rationale (high level).

### 15. Evaluation Strategy

Metrics, benchmarks, and human review plan.

### 16. Safety & Risk

Primary risks, mitigations, and trustworthiness considerations.

### 17. Constraints

Latency, cost, compliance, context limits.

### 18. Infrastructure (High-Level)

High-level infra considerations (not implementation details).
