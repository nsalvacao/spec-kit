## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **P015: Phase 0 onboarding integration** - Updated welcome message to show complete Phase 0 → SDD workflow
  - Phase 0 commands (`/speckit.ideate`, `/speckit.select`, `/speckit.structure`) now displayed in onboarding
  - Moved quality commands (`/speckit.clarify`, `/speckit.analyze`, `/speckit.checklist`) from "Enhancement Commands" to "Core SDD Workflow"
  - Auto-create `.gitignore` with security patterns for agent credentials:
    - `.github/agents/*.credentials.md`
    - `.specify/memory/*.sensitive.md`
  - Updated security notice to confirm automatic `.gitignore` protection
- **Upstream sync (2026-02-17)** - Integrated extension-system foundations from upstream:
  - `specify extension` command group and extension manager module
  - Extension docs/templates/test suite scaffolding
  - Antigravity (`agy`) agent support in CLI and packaging scripts
  - `constitution-template` initialization flow for new projects

### Fixed

- **P001: State management yq compatibility** - Replaced yq-based state scripts with Python implementation using PyYAML
  - Created `scripts/python/state-update.py` for atomic YAML updates
  - Updated `state-log-violation.sh/ps1`, `state-reconstruct.sh/ps1`, and `state-check.sh/ps1` to use Python backend
  - Eliminates yq v3/v4 syntax breaking changes
  - Provides atomic, safe YAML updates without external dependency on yq
- Security hardening for extension installation/registration:
  - Validate command file paths remain inside extension directory
  - Validate command aliases/identifiers before writing generated files
  - Validate extension IDs used by catalog downloads
  - Use generated temporary ZIP filenames for `specify extension add --from`

### Changed

- **Dependencies**: yq is no longer required for state management (Python 3 with PyYAML is used instead)

## [0.0.24] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- **Versioning**: Simplified version scheme to standard `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (SemVer), dropping the `-fork.N` suffix.
  - `pyproject.toml` version is now PEP 440 compliant.
  - `get-next-version.sh` now correctly parses patch versions that include pre-release suffixes.
- **CI**: Added `test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow — runs `pytest` on every push to `main` and on PRs.
- **CI**: Fixed `get-next-version.sh` to correctly extract the numeric patch component from fork-style version tags.

## [0.0.23-fork.1] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Fork version following the versioning scheme: upstream base version with fork suffix.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Support for overriding the template source via `SPECIFY_TEMPLATE_REPO` or `--template-repo` during `specify init`.
- Core dependency checks (python, uv, yq, rg) surfaced in `specify check` and prerequisite scripts.
- Phase 0 command documentation updates in README/installation.

## [0.0.22] - 2025-11-07

- Support for VS Code/Copilot agents, and moving away from prompts to proper agents with hand-offs.
- Move to use `AGENTS.md` for Copilot workloads, since it's already supported out-of-the-box.
- Adds support for the version command. ([#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486))
- Fixes potential bug with the `create-new-feature.ps1` script that ignores existing feature branches when determining next feature number ([#975](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/975))
- Add graceful fallback and logging for GitHub API rate-limiting during template fetch ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970))

## [0.0.21] - 2025-10-21

- Fixes [#975](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/975) (thank you [@fgalarraga](https://github.com/fgalarraga)).
- Adds support for Amp CLI.
- Adds support for VS Code hand-offs and moves prompts to be full-fledged chat modes.
- Adds support for `version` command (addresses [#811](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/811) and [#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486), thank you [@mcasalaina](https://github.com/mcasalaina) and [@dentity007](https://github.com/dentity007)).
- Adds support for rendering the rate limit errors from the CLI when encountered ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970), thank you [@psmman](https://github.com/psmman)).

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Intelligent Branch Naming**: `create-new-feature` scripts now support `--short-name` parameter for custom branch names
  - When `--short-name` provided: Uses the custom name directly (cleaned and formatted)
  - When omitted: Automatically generates meaningful names using stop word filtering and length-based filtering
  - Filters out common stop words (I, want, to, the, for, etc.)
  - Removes words shorter than 3 characters (unless they're uppercase acronyms)
  - Takes 3-4 most meaningful words from the description
  - **Enforces GitHub's 244-byte branch name limit** with automatic truncation and warnings
  - Examples:
    - "I want to create user authentication" → `001-create-user-authentication`
    - "Implement OAuth2 integration for API" → `001-implement-oauth2-integration-api`
    - "Fix payment processing bug" → `001-fix-payment-processing`
    - Very long descriptions are automatically truncated at word boundaries to stay within limits
  - Designed for AI agents to provide semantic short names while maintaining standalone usability

### Changed

- Enhanced help documentation for `create-new-feature.sh` and `create-new-feature.ps1` scripts with examples
- Branch names now validated against GitHub's 244-byte limit with automatic truncation if needed

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Support for CodeBuddy (thank you to [@lispking](https://github.com/lispking) for the contribution).
- You can now see Git-sourced errors in the Specify CLI.

### Changed

- Fixed the path to the constitution in `plan.md` (thank you to [@lyzno1](https://github.com/lyzno1) for spotting).
- Fixed backslash escapes in generated TOML files for Gemini (thank you to [@hsin19](https://github.com/hsin19) for the contribution).
- Implementation command now ensures that the correct ignore files are added (thank you to [@sigent-amazon](https://github.com/sigent-amazon) for the contribution).

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/speckit.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kit-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
  - Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

### Added

- Support for Roo Code.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-09-21

- Agent folder security notice displayed after project provisioning completion, warning users that some agents may store credentials or auth tokens in their agent folders and recommending adding relevant folders to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21
